I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, Virginia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised Prof. Sait Tunc. Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at Department of Mathematics, Xiamen University. I am broadly interested in queueing theory, game theory, stochastic modeling, Simulation, healthcare operations, and incentive mechanism design. I will be on the job market this year.
