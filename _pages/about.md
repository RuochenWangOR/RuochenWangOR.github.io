I am a fourth-year PhD student at [the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, Virginia Tech](https://www.ise.vt.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sait Tunc. I am broadly interested in queueing theory, game theory, stochastic modeling, and simulation with applications in healthcare operations, and incentive mechanism designs. I am on the job market for the 2025-2026 academic year.

# Teaching  

## Instructor (Summer 2024)  

**ISE 2024: Probability Foundations for Industrial and Systems Engineers**  
- **Core Sophomore-level Undergraduate Course (Class size: 55)**  
  - This core undergraduate course serves as a basis for applications courses in the industrial and systems engineering undergraduate curriculum. The course provides the foundation for the study of industrial statistics and quality control as well as for the sequence of probability modeling and analysis courses, such as stochastic processes and simulation modeling/analysis, as well as human factors and ergonomics and manufacturing courses.

## Teaching Assistant (2021 – 2023, Spring 2024)  

- **ISE 2024: Probability Foundations for Industrial and Systems Engineering**  
- **ISE 2404 - Deterministic Operations Research II**  
- **ISE 3034: Technical Communication for Engineers**  
- **ISE 3414: Probabilistic Operations Research**  
- **ISE 4264: Industrial Automation**
